# Uppload examples

This monorepo contains example projects using Uppload to help you get started quickly. All demos are available on [CodeSandbox](https://uppload.js.org/examples).

## 🐛 Issues

To manage issues better, we've disabled the GitHub "Issues" feature in this repo. If you want to report a problem or suggestion, please open an issue in the main [elninotech/uppload](https://github.com/elninotech/uppload) repo and add the "examples" label.

## 🛠 Development

This repo uses [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) to manage to manage multiple packages, all exposed as CodeSandbox demos. By default, each example uses the latest version of Uppload. Each package published to npm is scoped with `@uppload/`.
