This repo uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org) to manage to manage multiple packages as a monorepository. Using pnpm's [Workspaces](https://pnpm.js.org/en/workspaces), we only download a dependency once, but feel free to use npm, Yarn, or your preferred package manager locally.

By default, each example uses the latest version of Uppload. Each package is also published to npm is scoped with `@uppload/`.
